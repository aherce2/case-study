Spray Arm

The lower spray arm (as well as the upper and middle spray arms if applicable) could be the reason why your dishwasher is not cleaning properly. The function of the spray arms is to spray the dishes with a strong stream of hot water and detergent. If some of the holes are plugged, then you should also inspect the filter system for a possible problem. Cracks or separated seams in the spray arms will impair the force of the spray as well. If your dishwasher has an upper spray arm also inspect the spray arm mounting bracket to make sure it hasn't become loose, cracked or otherwise restricted.

How to inspect dishwasher spray arms:

Disconnect the appliance from the power source before beginning.
Open your dishwasher and visually inspect your spray arms. You are looking for any signs of wear, cracking, or damage. Inspect the holes of the arms to see if any dirt or debris is lodged in them, clean out anything you find.
Turn the spray arms manually. While doing so, you should be inspecting if there is much resistance, if the arms are wobbling, or if the arms hit the dish racks.
If your spray arms show any of the above symptoms, you will need replacement spray arms.

Detergent Dispenser

The detergent dispenser could be the cause of the dishwasher not cleaning your dishes. First, make sure you are using a high-quality detergent, and if you are using gel or tablets, consider switching to a powdered detergent as it dissolves faster.

Heating Element

Dishwashers need adequate hot water to properly clean the dishes, usually about 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The heating element, found at the bottom of the dishwasher is used to maintain the temperature of the water in the dishwasher, or to heat the water higher than normal for certain cycles depending on the cycle option selected. It is important to note that the heating element is not used to heat the water for normal wash cycles, so before checking the heating element, ensure that the water entering your dishwasher is hot enough. Please note that water hotter than 140-150 degrees is not recommended as damage to your dishes can occur with very hot water. Before starting a washing cycle, run the hot water in your sink for a few minutes. If hot water is going into your dishwasher, but the water temperature falls during the cycle even with a heating option selected, then you may need to replace the heating element.

How to test the heating element in a dishwasher with a multimeter:

Begin by disconnecting your appliance from the power source.
Locate your heating element, it will be found on the bottom of the tub and depending on your model, it may have a cover. If it does have a cover, remove it.
Remove the lower access panel and disconnect wires attached to the heating element’s terminals that protrude through the base of the dishwasher.
Set your multimeter to the Rx1 setting and touch the terminals with the probes. The reading of a functional heating element varies between models but will fall between zero and infinity, refer to your owner’s manual to determine what reading you should receive. If your reading is exactly zero or infinity, it is defective.
If your heating element’s reading is outside the manufacturer’s recommended range, you will need a replacement heating element.
