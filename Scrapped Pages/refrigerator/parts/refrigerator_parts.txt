Installation Instructions
Todd from TOLEDO, OH
The door bin on my Refrigerator broke
I received two bins as ordered. I could not use one because it was broken. I sent an email back to Parts Select about the bin broken in the shipment. Heard nothing back.
I did not know that the door bins were different sizes for the top of the door & bottom 2 bins. So now I have one bin that fits, One that doesn't fit & a broken one that does not fit.
Moral of the story? Take my money & send me a broken part & that does not fit due to Frigidaire having two different sizes.
I have never owned a more noisy refrigerator in my life except the refrigerator a GE, that I replaced with this one. It got very noisy before it quit.

Charles from Dallas, TX
One of my door bins and filter cap broke.
I searched the model number for my Whirlpool refrigerator on the internet and partselect.com came up so I clicked on it. The site asked for my model number which I typed in and there it was...a picture of my refrigerator in full detail and very well diagramed and labeled. I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid. In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition. I took them out of the box and installed them in less than 15 minutes. A parts internet order and repair has NEVER gone as quick and easy as this did. Thankyou Partselect for an awsome job and awsome website and even more awsome delivery time. Very happy and impressed with your service. Keep up the outstanding work!!!!!!

Support studs were broken
Used pliers to remove the residual broken stud that was still attached to the wall of the refrigerator, and then just pushed the new part in place. The longest time was spent in removing the food and crisper drawers.

Common Refrigerator Problems and How to Fix Them

Troubleshooting refrigerator problems might seem overwhelming, but we are here to help you get to the bottom of the problem. We will walk you through common refrigerator issues, as well as the parts that might be the fix you need.

Noisy Refrigerator – It can be alarming if you hear loud noises coming from your fridge. It is not uncommon to notice buzzing, humming, clicking, and knocking noises. Figuring out the cause might be as simple as locating what section of your refrigerator it is coming from. Most often these sounds are caused by the parts that are in motion, like the condenser fan motor, and evaporator fan motor. If you notice a scraping sound it is often cause by one of the internal fans making contact with something as it spins. If it is rattling you notice be sure to check the fridge is level, and make sure drain pan is secured properly. A mild humming noise is normal, but if you notice an increased humming sound, the compressor might be overworked.

Leaking Refrigerator – If you notice water leaking from your fridge, or inside, there is no need to panic, most often these leaks are simple to fix. Troubleshooting a leaking refrigerator starts with identifying where you find the water pooling. To solve this problem, you are going to want to first inspect your door gaskets and seals, inlet valves, water lines, and ice maker. These are the most common culprits when it comes to refrigerator leaks.

Refrigerator Will Not Run – When the compressor in your refrigerator will not run the appliance will not be able to cool. It could be as simple as an issue with your start capacitor, overload, temperature control, or control board. These are the parts that monitor internal temperature and communicate with the compressor. If you have ruled those parts out the issue may be with the compressor itself.

Ice Maker Not Making Ice – If your ice maker is not making ice, it can often mean it is not getting the water it needs. It could be an issue with the water line, water inlet valve, or a water filter. Inspecting these parts will let you know if there is water flowing to the ice maker, and allow you to spot any issues with the water supply. Before looking at the water supply, we recommend you start by looking at the ice maker to make sure the bail arm is not stuck. If it is, your ice maker will stop making ice because it thinks the bin is full. Checking these parts and others is simple process. Your ice maker will be up and running in no time.

Refrigerator Too Warm – When your fridge is not getting cold enough it is often a simple fix, it does not always signal control board issues. If your fridge is appropriately stocked, we suggest you start by checking the air circulation in the appliance. The first step is making sure the air damper or baffle is undamaged, and unblocked; that is how cool air gets into your fridge. If that is fine you will need to then inspect the evaporator fan, condenser fan, and the temperature senor. It is also important to ensure you are routinely cleaning the condenser coils to help prevent issues like this.
